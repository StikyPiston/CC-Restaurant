---[ CC-RESTAURANT ]---

A little program I wrote, which is an ordering system for a restaurant!

# SETUP

You will need: 2x Computers, 2x modems, ?x Monitors, 1x Printer, ?x modem cables

1. Download the "Receiving" folder, and place the contained files into the root of a computer (/startup, /orders)
2. Attatch a monitor to the computer, and a modem on the left
3. Change the line in "startup" to match the monitor (eg. monitor_0, top, left, etc.)
4. Reboot the receiving Computer
5. Download the "Kiosk" folder, and unzip the contents to the root of the Kiosk PC (/startup, /lib/termLib)
6. Add a printer underneath the Kiosk PC, and a modem on top
7. Reboot the Kiosk PC
8. Change the ID in the "startup" file of the Kiosk PC to that of the Receiving PC

## USAGE

On the Kiosk PC, you will type out your order.
A receipt will be printed. Take it from the printer.
The order will be sent to the kitchen, and be displayed on the monitor

The receipt will contain your order and ordernumber. Make sure to keep the receipt in the offhand
so you can see the number when the employees call it.
If the printer fails, remember the ordernumber, and contact staff about the printer being empty.
